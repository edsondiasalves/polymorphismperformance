# C# Polymorphism Trade-Offs

This project explores the trade-offs between performance and maintainability in C# development, specifically focusing on the use of polymorphism. The goal is to understand the implications of adopting a polymorphic design versus relying on a series of if-else statements in terms of execution speed and code maintainability.
